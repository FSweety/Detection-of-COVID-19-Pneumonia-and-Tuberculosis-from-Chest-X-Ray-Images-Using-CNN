ü©∫ Detection of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis from Chest X-Ray Images Using CNN
üìò Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify chest X-ray images into three major disease categories ‚Äî COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis ‚Äî along with Normal cases.
The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a fast, reliable, and automated diagnostic tool based on medical imaging.

Developed as part of an academic assignment on Digital Image Processing (DIP).

üéØ Objectives

Build a CNN-based image classification model for detecting COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis.

Apply data preprocessing and augmentation to improve model generalization.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize training results using confusion matrices, loss curves, and accuracy graphs.

üß© Dataset

Dataset Name: Chest X-Ray Dataset (4 Categories)

Source: Kaggle - pritpal2873/chest-x-ray-dataset-4-categories

Categories:

COVID-19

Pneumonia

Tuberculosis

Normal

The dataset includes labeled X-ray images used to train, validate, and test the CNN model.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Downloaded dataset using KaggleHub

Split into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets

Resized and normalized all X-ray images

2. Model Architecture

The CNN architecture includes:

Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation

MaxPooling for feature reduction

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

Fully connected (Dense) layers for classification

Softmax output layer for multi-class prediction

3. Training

Loss Function: categorical_crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Metrics: accuracy

Early stopping applied to prevent overfitting

4. Evaluation
